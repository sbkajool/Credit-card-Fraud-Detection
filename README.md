# Credit-card-Fraud-Detection
## Project Objective:
This GitHub project aims to develop an efficient credit card fraud detection system using machine learning techniques. Leveraging the Capital One Synthetic Card transaction dataset, this project seeks to create a predictive model that can identify fraudulent activities and uncover the underlying characteristics associated with them. The primary goals of the project are:

Identify key features and patterns indicative of fraudulent transactions.
Implement classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Means, to effectively classify transactions as either genuine or fraudulent.
Provide insightful visualizations and analysis of the model's output to enhance understanding and decision-making.

## Method of Analysis:
The project follows a structured methodology to achieve its objectives:
** Data Understanding and Cleaning:** 
Explanation of the dataset, including independent and dependent variables, along with column descriptions.
Removal of duplicate entries and handling missing values to ensure data quality.
Descriptive Statistics:
Calculation and presentation of summary statistics to gain initial insights into the dataset.

Visualizations:
Histograms for numeric columns to understand their distributions.
Bar charts for categorical columns to visualize frequency distributions.
Scatter plots for exploring relationships between pairs of numeric columns.

    Outlier Analysis:
        Identification and analysis of outliers in the dataset, which could impact model performance.

    Revised Descriptive Statistics:
        After handling outliers, updated summary statistics are calculated and interpreted.

    Model Design for Fraud Detection:
        Development of machine learning models using classification algorithms.
        Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Means are employed to classify transactions.

    Correlation Analysis:
        Exploration of correlations between different variables to uncover potential insights.

    Dealing with Class Imbalance:
        Addressing the issue of class imbalance to ensure the model's ability to accurately predict both genuine and fraudulent transactions.

    Machine Learning Models:
        Implementation of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models.
        These models are trained and evaluated to determine their effectiveness in fraud detection.

Insights and Output:
The project's outcome includes valuable insights derived from the analysis and model outputs. The GitHub repository provides comprehensive documentation of the steps taken throughout the analysis, from data preprocessing to model implementation. Visualizations, code snippets, and explanations offer a clear understanding of the methods used and the results obtained.

This project not only serves as an educational resource for understanding credit card fraud detection but also provides a practical example of how to approach such problems using machine learning techniques. The code, findings, and visualizations can be leveraged by researchers, data scientists, and developers to enhance their understanding of fraud detection and contribute to the field's ongoing development.
