# Credit-card-Fraud-Detection
### (Using PySpark)

## Project Objective:
This GitHub project aims to develop an efficient credit card fraud detection system using machine learning techniques. Leveraging the Capital One Synthetic Card transaction dataset, this project seeks to create a predictive model that can identify fraudulent activities and uncover the underlying characteristics associated with them. The primary goals of the project are:

Identify key features and patterns indicative of fraudulent transactions.
Implement classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Means, to effectively classify transactions as either genuine or fraudulent.
Provide insightful visualizations and analysis of the model's output to enhance understanding and decision-making.

## Method of Analysis:
* Thoroughly explain the dataset, highlighting independent and dependent variables.
* Cleanse the data to eliminate duplications and manage missing values.
* Perform Descriptive Statistics to gain a comprehensive overview of the dataset's key metrics.
* Utilize visualizations such as histograms for numeric columns, bar charts for categorical columns, and scatter plots for numeric column comparisons.
* Conduct Outlier Analysis to identify potential anomalies affecting the data quality.
* Regenerate Descriptive Statistics after addressing outliers.
* Design and develop classification models tailored for fraud detection, leveraging techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
* Perform Correlation Analysis to assess the relationships between variables and identify potential predictors of fraud.
* Address class imbalance issues through suitable techniques to ensure the model's effectiveness in detecting both genuine and fraudulent transactions.
* Deploy various Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) to predict credit card fraud accurately.

This project serves as an invaluable resource for those interested in understanding credit card fraud detection methodologies, applying machine learning techniques to real-world financial datasets, and contributing to the ongoing battle against fraudulent activities. By openly sharing the project on GitHub, it invites collaboration, feedback, and improvements from the wider data science community, fostering innovation in fraud detection techniques and enhancing the security of financial transactions for users worldwide.
